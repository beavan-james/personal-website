# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Agent behavior

### "Grill Me" skill
Relentless interviewing skill that stress-tests plans and designs through systematic questioning.

What it does:
Conducts deep-dive questioning across all aspects of a plan, walking through decision trees branch-by-branch until shared understanding is reached
Automatically explores the codebase to answer questions where code context is available, reducing redundant back-and-forth
Designed for design reviews, architecture validation, and pre-implementation planning where thorough vetting prevents downstream issues.
